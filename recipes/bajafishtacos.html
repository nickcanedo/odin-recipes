    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Baja Fish Tacos are soft tortilla shells which contain beer-battered cod and are topped with pico de gallo and a cilantro ranch dressing.</p>
    <p>I was first introduced to these tacos during a dinner in the Distillery District, located in downtown Toronto, at the <em>El Catrin</em> restaurant.</p>
    <p>These were a recommendation by one of the staff members and they were amazing. From the taste, to the quantity, to the presentation, they were simply perfection.</p>
    <p>Without further to do, let's make some Baja Fish Tacos!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>Baja Fish Taco Sauce:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 cup</em> mayo</li>
        <li><em>½ cup</em> sour cream</li>
        <li><em>5 cloves</em> garlic</li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon</em> lime zest</li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon</em> lime juice</li>
        <li><em>¼ teaspoon</em> cayenne pepper</li>
        <li><em>¼ teaspoon</em> (slightly heaping) salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Citrus Slaw:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 teaspoon</em> orange zest</li>
        <li><em>¼ cup</em> fresh-squeezed orange juice</li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon</em> lime juice</li>
        <li><em>Pinch</em> salt</li>
        <li><em>Pinch</em> black pepper</li>
        <li><em>1 teaspoon</em> agave or honey</li>
        <li><em>¼ cup</em> olive or avocado oil</li>
        <li><em>4 cups</em> thinly shredded green cabbage</li>
        <li><em>2 cups</em> thinly shredded red cabbage</li>
        <li><em></em> cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Fish Tacos:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 ¼ pound</em> cod, cut into short strips or bite-size chunks</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li><em>Pinch</em> cayenne pepper</li>
        <li><em>½ teaspoon</em> ground cumin</li>
        <li><em>½ teaspoon</em> ground coriander</li>
        <li><em>½ teaspoon</em> granulated garlic</li>
        <li><em>1 ½ cups</em> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><em>1 (12 ounce)</em> bottle of beer (I used a Mexican lager)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas, warm (about 24 tortillas so you can double up on each taco)</li>
        <li>Cilantro leaves, lime, sliced radishes, for garnish</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your spicy garlic-lime mayo by placing all ingredients into a food processor and processing until smooth and combined; pour into a bowl, or into a squeeze bottle, ideally.</li>
        <li>Prepare your citrus slaw by whisking together the orange zest, orange juice, lime juice, pinch of salt and pepper, agave or honey, and oil until well-combined (you can also shake these vigorously in a small mason jar for convenience), and set aside for a moment; add both of your shredded cabbages and the cilantro into a medium-size bowl, and toss the dressing you just made with the cabbage/cilantro; keep cold.</li>
        <li>To prepare you fish tacos, add your cod pieces to a bowl and season with a couple of pinches of salt and pepper, plus the cayenne, cumin, coriander and garlic powder; allow them to marinate for a few minutes while you get your oil ready and prepare to fry.</li>
        <li>Prepare a baking sheet with foil and a place a wire rack over top (if you have one) to hold the cod once it's been fried; next, add enough oil to a deep pan or a medium-size pot so that the fish can be submerged when you fry it (about 3 cups), and bring it to 365°.</li>
        <li>While your oil heats, whisk together the flour with a couple of pinches of salt and pepper, and slowly pour in the beer and whisk just until smooth; once the oil is hot, dip the pieces of cod into the batter and fry in batches (it took 3 batches for me) for a 3-4 minutes or until golden-brown.</li>
        <li>To assemble, add a couple of pieces of the fried cod to the bottom of a couple of corn tortillas, top with a generous amount of the slaw, add in some radishes (if using), drizzle the spicy garlic-lime sauce liberally over top, and finish with some extra cilantro and a squeeze of lime.</li>
    </ol>
