    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Jokes aside, it is a simple, and very tasteful dish that can be found at nearly any store.</p>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>For the Pizza Dough:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 ball</em> of thin crust pizza dough</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the Pizza Sauce:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 small</em> garlic clove</li>
        <li><em>15 ounces</em> of crushed fire roasted tomatoes or high quality organic canned tomatoes</li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon</em> of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><em>½ tablespoons</em> of dried oregano</li>
        <li><em>½ teaspoons</em> of kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the Toppings:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1/4 to 1/3 cups</em> of pizza sauce</li>
        <li><em>¾ cups</em> of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese for topping</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven/li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce: Cut the garlic into a few rough pieces. Place the garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano and kosher salt in a blender. Blend until fully combined. (You will use about ⅓ cup for the pizza; reserve the remaining sauce and refrigerate for up to 1 week)</li>
        <li>Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photos of the pre-baked pizza above). If it is incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you do not have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel </li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, using about ¼ to ⅓ cup. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a thin layer of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a few pinches of kosher salt</li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven)</li>
        <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before adding the basil on top (whole leaves, lightly torn, or thinly sliced). Slice into pieces and serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
