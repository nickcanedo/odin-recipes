Author: Nicolas Rebollo Canedo-Arguelles
Project Title: The Odin Project Recipes Project

Background: 
- This will be the first HTML-based project that I will complete as a part of The Odin Project's full-stack developer curriculum.
- This project will solidify webpage creation and version control principles and techniques such as atomic commits and proper directory file structure

Goals:
- Commit often, but not in a meaningless manner
- Ensure commit messages are descriptive, have a separate title and body, and are written in imperative language
- Organize webpages within directory according to proper file structure
- Ensure home webpage is named index and all other webpages (recipes) are inserted into a 'pages' directory
- Get comfortable with basic git commands used from the command terminal
- Practice correct tag and element usage within HTML source code
- Use proper indentations for parent-child-sibling relationships between tags to make code easy to read and follow
- Learn to push website with several pages from local machine to remote GitHub repository
